## Mini Project: Work Around

WorkAround is a human resources program that returns basic information about an employee, based on salary data. Using WorkAround, one can use an employeeâ€™s salary data to:

    * return the cadre of the of the employee, in other words, whether this employee is entry level, mid level, or senior level.

    * calculate employee tax rates

    * return employee benefits

    * calculate employee bonuses

    * calculate the total amount an employee can be reimbursed based on the total value of their health, housing, or wellness benefits

We are using ES6 syntax for import/export modules.

The `4_2_1_original.js` file will be divided into 2 files(`4_2_2_employee.js` and `4_2_3_workAround.js`) to show how to `import/export module` is worked.
