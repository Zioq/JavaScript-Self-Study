## Send JSON through AJAX POST

This basic code for the show how to send a post request to the web server and for demonstration I'm going to PHP to actually receive and then convert that JSON string into a PHP object.

Happy Coding :D

    PS. To check how to work code in the Web page, you have to open the index.html file through Web Server Applicaiotn such as MAMP :)
