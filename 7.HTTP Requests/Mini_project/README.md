## Mini Project

Using `fetch`, `async`, and `await`, you'll request information from some API homepage to create a travel website

    # <API>
     "Foursquare API"
     https://developer.foursquare.com/

     "OpenWeather API"
     https://openweathermap.org/current

I recommand you to create your own account and make API key for this app.

Happy Coding :)
