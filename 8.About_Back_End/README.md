   < Back-End >             < Front-End >
    |       | <=Request(1)   |         |
    |       |                |         |

    The specific format of request (and the resulting response) is called the **protocol**. (ex.HTML). 
    When a visitor navigators to a website on their browser, similarly to how one places an order for take out, they make an HTTP Request for the resources that make that site.
